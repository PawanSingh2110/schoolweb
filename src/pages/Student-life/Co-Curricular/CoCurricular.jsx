      Co-curricular activities are an integral part of the life of a student. They are much more than mere recreational activities; they provide important directions to a student on his journey to self-discovery. These activities hone the softer skills, the aesthetic senses, design consciousness, sensitivity of feelings, dignity of labour, team work, inclusivity and link the physical skills to the mind and emotion. These are run during activity lessons so that cooperation and mutual respect prevails over selfish conduct through a wide range of co-curricular activities and Social Work platforms.
